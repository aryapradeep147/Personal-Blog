      <h2><b>My web development Journey with Upskill 2.0</b></h2>
      <h5>Posted on June 10,2023</h5>
      
     <p> Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to share my experience of learning web development through Upskill 2.0, a 2 week boot camp conducted by Tinkerhub club in my college. It has been an incredible journey, filled with growth, challenges, and exciting discoveries. In this blog post, I'll take you through my Upskill 2.0 experience and how it has shaped my web development skills.
      </p>
      <p>When I first joined Upskill 2.0, I was amazed by the comprehensive curriculum they offered. The program started by laying a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. Through interactive tutorials, coding and exercises I quickly grasped the core concepts of web development and gained hands-on experience building static web pages.</p>
     <p>
      As I progressed, Upskill 2.0 introduced more topics like signup page using bootstrap, which made me learn so many things .Upskill 2.0 was a great oppertunity to find out my skills and true potential because I didn't know much about web development.A special mention to my senior Chaithanya for helping me understand web development better.She was very approachable and cleared all our clarifications on time. I express my sincere gratitude for her time , efforts and guidance.
